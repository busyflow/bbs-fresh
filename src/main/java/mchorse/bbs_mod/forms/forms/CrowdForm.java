/**
 * Puts one of the film's crowds on a replay's timeline so it can be keyframed.
 *
 * <p>The form does not hold the crowd. The film does - who they are, how many, and where they
 * stand are settings of the crowd itself, kept in step with the world by the reconciler, which
 * is what stops a crowd from silently failing to appear. This only names which crowd a replay
 * drives.</p>
 *
 * <p>What it buys is the reason it exists: a replay carrying this form is given the crowd
 * keyframe channels - where they walk, what they look at, when they jump, and what they wear -
 * so those are authored on the timeline with the same curves and the same editor as everything
 * else, instead of a second keyframe system built for crowds alone.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately thin. An earlier version of this form carried every spawn and behaviour
 * setting itself, which made it the only place a crowd could be described and capped a crowd at
 * two thousand members. Existence stays with the film and animation stays here; collapsing the
 * two back together is what put crowds on clips and lost them.</p>
