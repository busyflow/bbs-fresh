 * editor preview so both agree exactly.
 *
 * <p>The waypoints are one route, and a member is placed by asking where the route is at that
 * member's own time. Stagger is a delay in ticks, so a member who set off late is simply further
 * back along the same curve - it never has to catch up and there is nothing to catch up to. The
 * previous shape, where progress ran 0 to 1 within each segment and was clamped at both ends, is
 * what made the crowd gather at every waypoint and wait for its stragglers before setting off
 * again.</p>
 *
 * <p>What a member is given is a displacement - how far the route has moved from its first
 * waypoint - added to wherever that member was standing. Placing members around the waypoint
 * instead cannot work for painted ground, which is somewhere in particular and not free to be
 * re-centred.</p>
