/**
 * A crowd the film owns: who they are, where they stand, and when they exist.
 *
 * <p>This used to be an action clip, which made a crowd an event - something that happens at a
 * moment and is gone from the model afterwards. That was the wrong shape for it. A crowd is not
 * an event; it is a group of people who are present over a stretch of the film, and describing
 * it as a firing has cost real bugs: a spawn that was missed for any reason left no crowd and no
 * error, and the only way to find out was to look at the shot and see nobody there.</p>
 *
 * <p>As a thing the film owns, the question each tick is not "did the spawn fire?" but "should
 * this crowd be here now?" - and if it should and is not, it is made so. There is no firing to
 * miss. See {@link CrowdReconciler}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Field ids match the old {@code CrowdSpawnActionClip} exactly, so converting an old film is
 * a copy of the clip's data rather than a field-by-field translation.</p>
