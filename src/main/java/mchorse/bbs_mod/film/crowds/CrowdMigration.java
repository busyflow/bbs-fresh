/**
 * Turns the crowd spawn clips of an older film into crowds the film owns.
 *
 * <p>Run when a film is loaded, so opening an old one is the whole of the upgrade - there is
 * nothing for anyone to do by hand and no film that works differently from the rest afterwards.
 * The clip class stays registered so those films still deserialize; this is what empties it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every member's identity is derived from the crowd's tag and seed, both of which are carried
 * over unchanged, so a converted crowd stands exactly where it did before.</p>
